 CODING ACTIVITY - Full Stack Developer NodeJS, React, PostgreSQL 
 Thank you for taking the time to take on the engineering challenge! We use this project as a  way to understand your coding abilities as well as how you would work on a project. When  you submit your code, we are not just looking for code that works but for code that is 
 production ready  and is able to be merged into our  codebase.  Here are the criteria we look for when we review your code.  1.) Does your code work? Are all features in working condition?  2.) Code Readability.  3.) Code Reusability.  4.) Error Handling.  5.) Testability.  6.) JS/CSS/HTML fundamentals and best practices  This is code you would feel proud to submit to a real project. Please develop the assignment  using  NodeJS, ReactJS (feel free to use any server  and ui framework or libraries such  as express, nest, next etc) and any RDBMS (preferably postgreSQL)  , and please submit  your project as a GitHub or Gitlab repo with instructions on how to run your project. Please  also include assumptions and tradeoffs you made while building out the component. 
 Delivery Expected: 
 1)   please submit your project as a GitHub or Gitlab repo with instructions on how to run  your project.(in case of unclear instructions or errors while compiling the code,  assignment will be rejected)  2)   Host your code on the vercel, netlify or any platform of your choice and share the  link. 
 A detailed specification of this CODING ACTIVITY is available below. 
 1) Build a  ECOMMERCE  database in  PostgreSQL

 Id   SERIAL   PK 
 orderDescription   VARCHAR(100)   NOT NULL 
 createdAt   TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL 
 Create  PRODUCTS  table as below 
 Id   INT   PK 
 productName   VARCHAR(100)   NOT NULL 
 productDescription   TEXT 
 Create  OrderProductMap  table 
 Id   SERIAL   PK 
 orderId   INT   FK {ORDERS.Id} | NOT NULL 
 productId   INT   FK {PRODUCTS.Id} | NOT NULL 
 2) Insert below values in  PRODUCT  table 
 Id  productName   productDescription 
 1  HP laptop   This is HP laptop 
 2  lenovo laptop   This is lenovo 
 3  Car   This is Car 
 4  Bike   This is Bike 
 3) Build the following REST API 
 Methods   Urls   Actions 
 GET   api/order   get all Orders 
 GET   api/order/:id   get Order  by id 
 POST   api/orders   add new Order 
 PUT   api/orders/:id   update Order by id 
 DELETE   api/orders/:id   remove Order by id 
 4) Build a Order management Screen (see wireframe below), below is just a wireframe use a good  looking styling css and neat/clean UI  ●   Search should filter the table for matching “order id” or “Order Description”
